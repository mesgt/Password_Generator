# Application Details

## Purpose

The goal of this app was to provide the user with an easy and convenient way of generating sercure passwords. 

## Description

With cybersecurity hackers all around us, your grandma's generic password will no longer suffice. This website will allow the user to select not only the length of the secure password, but also the types of characters including- capital and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The user simply selects the parameters via pop-up prompts and the password is displayed.

## Future Development

Ideas for future development include:
1. Option for the user to copy the password with a click of a button
2. Change pop-up prompts to be a modal that shows a form for the user to select password parameters all at one time
